# Sensor Measurement Analysis for a Large Data Set Using MPI in Python

### Contributors: Jamie Benater, Rachel Edelstein, Ryan Selesnik

This repository contains the following files: helperFunctions.py, parallelFileRead.py, scatterImplementation.py

This program computes statistical indicators on a given data set, generated by a sensor in an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) device. The program uses MPI in Python, using the mpi4py library, to complete the task using paralell techniques to improve efficiency. The statistical indicators calculated in the program are, namely: median, minimum, maximum, both upper and lower quartiles, as well as outliers. These are used to generate a box-and-whisker plot. The final results are written to a CSV file.

The user is required to specify/provide a data set and the given time range on which to perform the measurement analysis.

## Compiling and Running

To run the code with the example data set given in `/data/Accelerometer.csv`, use the following command and choose option (1):

```
./run.sh 10 ./data/Accelerometer.csv
```

This will run the code using the nodes specified in `./hostfile`
